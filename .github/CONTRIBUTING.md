Pull requests are happily accepted here, but please note the following:

Any changes to [mapping.yml](mapping.yml) require a complete rebuild of the
OpenInfraMap database - a fairly manual process which takes about a week.
Please submit these in a separate pull request from any other changes and note
that these may have to wait several months until I have a window of time to
rebuild.
